Salutations,

I would love it if you could fill out the `printList()` and `createList()`functions in main.cpp.

Start with `printList()`. The other function, `createList()` is *very challenging*.

`printList()` should accept the head of a list and print the list. 

`createList()` should accept an integer representing size of the list to create, create the list, and return the head.
